# About Vue DnD Hooks

## The Story Behind

Vue DnD Hooks was born from my experience with React DnD Kit. While working with it, I was impressed by its elegant API and powerful features. However, when I switched to Vue.js projects, I couldn't find a library that offered the same level of flexibility and modern development experience.

::: tip Inspiration
The API design is intentionally similar to React DnD Kit, as I consider it one of the best approaches to drag and drop functionality in the React ecosystem.

## Why Create Another Library?

Looking at existing Vue.js drag and drop solutions, I found several common limitations:

- Most libraries were built for Vue 2
- Poor integration with Nuxt
- Limited customization options
- Inflexible animation systems
- Restricted drag layer customization

::: info Modern Approach
I built Vue DnD Hooks exclusively for the Composition API, deliberately moving away from the Options API to embrace modern Vue.js practices and provide better TypeScript integration.

## Key Features

### Custom Layer System

Unlike other libraries, Vue DnD Hooks provides complete control over drag previews and animations. You can:

- Define custom containers for dragged elements
- Create unique drag previews
- Implement any animation system
- Control every aspect of the visual feedback

### Flexible Architecture

The library works seamlessly with both VDOM and DOM:

- Direct DOM manipulation when needed for performance
- Full Virtual DOM integration for complex updates
- Smart event handling system
- Efficient touch event processing

### Universal Solution

Whatever your drag and drop needs are, Vue DnD Hooks can handle it:

- Sortable lists
- Tree structures
- Multi-drag operations
- Nested components
- Custom drop zones
- Complex drag previews

::: warning Composition API Only
The library exclusively supports the Composition API. While this might seem limiting, it allows for a better developer experience and maintaining a clean, modern codebase.

## Looking Forward

Vue DnD Hooks is actively maintained and developed. My focus is on:

- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced customization options
- Improved TypeScript types
- New features based on community feedback
- Maintaining simplicity while adding power

::: tip Contributing
I welcome contributions and feedback from the community! Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, every contribution helps make Vue DnD Hooks better.

## Technical Philosophy

The development is guided by several key principles:

1. **Modern First**: Embracing the latest Vue.js features and best practices
2. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript support for better developer experience
3. **Flexibility**: Providing low-level hooks that can be composed into complex behaviors
4. **Performance**: Optimizing for speed without compromising features
5. **Developer Experience**: Creating an intuitive and powerful API

I believe that by focusing on these principles, I can create a library that not only solves current drag and drop needs but also scales well for future requirements.
